# All_Keeper
This is a repo created for the project to be developed as part of the course COEN 6311

This project aims to develop a web-based dormitory service containing three sub-services - housekeeping, stationery, and cafeteria service.

The students can-
1. Request a service
2. Schedule a service
3. Rate the service

The dorm supervisor or system admin can- 
1. Add/remove students, housekeepers, manage the cafeteria orders
2. Edit the schedule based on requests.
3. View ratings and detailed descriptions for each action.

The housekeepers and delivery guys can:
1. Accept requests.
2. Complete and view ratings (not detailed).

The storekeeper can:
1. Manage the inventories.
2. Accept the requests.

There was no integrated payment method in the system. This is left for future works.
